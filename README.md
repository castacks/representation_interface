### What is this repository for? ###

This repository defines an interface for planning code to access perception data-structures. 
Instead of planning codes depending on perception packages directly, they depend on representation interface.
The perception code implements child classes of representation interface to implement the functions 
such as get value of cost map at a point etc

### How do I get set up? ###

Look at the package nea_representation_interface for setup
